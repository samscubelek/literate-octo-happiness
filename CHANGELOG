Current:
I have deicided to implement a database system into my app, the reason is to store information of contacts of employees and supervisiors within the company. 
As well as using other various ways to store data like using shared preferences, and files. 
I will include an action bar as well as adding action items .

Previous:
I have only did the basic outline of the app to help figure out the key points to my code. I was struggling a bit on how to start but I have a basic understanding of the concepts. 


Future updates:
I will finally implement my changes and get started on the user interface using UI. As well as implementing databases onto my app using SQlite.
