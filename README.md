Outline for Android App 

-Product Description:
 The app I have in mind is to help security businesses, especially for businesses that have multiple locations. The app would be able to track employees by a GPS system in case of any emergencies. There location is always present and can allow managers or other employees to see where everyone is located. As well as increase particpation for the security guards to check in on the app on their location and checkpoints they are assigned to throughout the day. This allows the manager and supervisors to check on multiple locations at once without being there physically.  
 
-Problem Addressed:
  The business problem would pertain to security employee’s participation in their role and safety. Some security businesses have multiple corporate sites where security guards are present and it can be challenging for the manager to oversee all employees since they cannot be in multiple places at once.
  
-Platform:
 I will be using cloud tools for Android studio used in the IDE that can help with the application and the cloud based application makes sure it’s accessible everywhere for security guards. 

-Front/back end support:
  For Front end I will be using XML in Android Studio and for back end would be Android Java coding. 
  
-Functionality:
  The overall design of the app will be simple and would easily be used by employees and managers to be able to see the positions of all employees in multiple locations. As well as a well put list of all checkpoints that need to be accomplished for the day. Progress can be sent and notified to manager. 
  
-Design:
  For my overall design I will using the help of Android SDK, which can ulitize the user interface. As well as improving the layout performance and space and GridLayout.
