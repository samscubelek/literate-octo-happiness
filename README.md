Formal Report

I. Introduction:
For my project app that I have developed for this class is called Security Tracker. This app is designed for businesses that hold employees in a security setting. This app can help track employees, being able to contact others, assign checkpoints, and bring better supervision of other employees. Below I will list the components of this app, like the platform, front/back end support, functionality, and design. 

II. Problem Addressed
The business problem would pertain to security employee’s participation in their role and safety. Some security businesses have multiple corporate sites where security guards are present and it can be challenging for the manager to oversee all employees since they cannot be in multiple places at once. By addressing the problem, my app can help the ability to track multiple employees in different locations at once by a GPS system. As well as having a button to choose to alert an employee if they need assistance. This can be done using SMS messages by performing an action when a certain SMS message is received. 

III. Platform
I will be using cloud tools for Android studio used in the IDE that can help with the application and the cloud based application makes sure it’s accessible everywhere for security guards.

IV. Front/Back end support
For the Front end I will be using XML in Android Studio and for the back end would be Kotlin, since it’s a more easier language than Java. It’s more efficient and requires less code and still is able to complete the tasks. 

V. Functionality
The overall design of the app will be simple and would easily be used by employees and managers to be able to see the positions of all employees in multiple locations. This can be done with creating a service that runs in the background since the application will continually record the geographical coordinates of the user’s device. This is very important for GPS tracking because there is no need to present a UI to the user.  As well as a well put list of all checkpoints that need to be accomplished for the day. Progress can be sent and notified to the manager. This can be done with SMS messaging by sending and receiving SMS messages in the app. 

VI. Design
 For my overall design I will use the help of Android SDK, which can utilize the user interface. As well as improving the layout performance, space and GridLayout. For the GPS tracking system it will be a LBS app using Google Maps to help locate employees. By using the LocationManager class this will allow my application to obtain periodic updates of the user’s device location and whenever they enter an proximity of a certain location for instance, their work building.
